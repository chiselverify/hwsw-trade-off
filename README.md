# Hardware/Software Trade-off for the Reduction of Energy Consumption

Programs running on a general purpose computer consume a considerable amount
of energy. Some programs can be translated into hardware and executed on an FPGA.
This project will explore the trade-offs between executing a program in hardware
and executing it in software relative to energy consumption.

This project is funded by the [Digital Research Centre Denmark (DIREC)](https://direc.dk/)
as project number P23.
Furthermore, is it embedded in the COST Action no. CA19135
[Connecting Education and Research Communities for an Innovative
Resource Aware Society (CERCIRAS)](https://www.cerciras.org/).
