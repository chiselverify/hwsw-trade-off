# Hardware/Software Trade-off for the Reduction of Energy Consumption

Programs running on a general purpose computer consume a considerable amount
of energy. Some programs can be translated into hardware and executed on an FPGA.
This project will explore the trade-offs between executing a program in hardware
and executing it in software relative to energy consumption.
